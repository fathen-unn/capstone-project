# capstone-project
Portfolio project on optimizing a model for real-life data.

This model is trained on a collection of SMS messages from the UCI Machine Learning Repository,
it accurately distinguishes between spam and legitimate text messages. 

It analyzes message content using a technique called "bag-of-words" to identify patterns associated with spam. 
In tests, it correctly classified 97.67% of messages, and its consistent performance across different data 
splits suggests it can generalize well to new messages.
